# Mapping Biolink Model to a RDF triple store
>>>>>>> Stashed changes


This is similar to [Mapping to Neo4j](mapping-neo4j). One difference is that Neo4j uses a property-graph model, 
whereas a RDF graph is a triple store, and must employ a technique such as RDF reification or 
named graphs to attach information to a triple.


## Nodes

Each node in a graph corresponds to an RDF resource. See [NamedThing](../docs/NamedThing) for the base class.

The [id](../docs/id) field is a CURIE, which maps to the resource IRI/URI using a standard prefix expansion. 
The RDF graph MAY include the CURIE shortform using a triple with `dcterms:identifier` as predicate and the
CURIE as a literal.

The [name](../docs/name) field maps to `rdfs:label`.


## Types and Categories

TBD: use rdf:type or include additional category


## Mapping Edges

An edge maps to an RDF triple.

See [biolink:Association](../docs/Association) for a list of generic properties that are associated with an edge.

### Wikidata Reification


### Standard RDF Reification


### Use of NamedGraphs

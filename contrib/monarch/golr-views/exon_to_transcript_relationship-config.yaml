    in an association
  display_name: relation

  property: []
- description: Additional relationships that are true of the subject in the context

    state
  display_name: subject extensions
  id: subject_extensions
  property: []
- description: Additional relationships that are true of the object in the context
    of the association. For example, if the object is an anatomical term in an expression
    association, the object extensions may include part-of links

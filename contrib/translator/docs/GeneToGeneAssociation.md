## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
## Children

 * [GeneToGeneHomologyAssociation](GeneToGeneHomologyAssociation.md) - A homology association between two genes. May be orthology (in which case the species of subject and object should differ) or paralogy (in which case the species may be the same)
 * [PairwiseGeneOrProteinInteractionAssociation](PairwiseGeneOrProteinInteractionAssociation.md) - An interaction between two genes or two gene products. May be physical (e.g. protein binding) or genetic (between genes). May be symmetric (e.g. protein interaction) or directed (e.g. phosphorylation)
## Used in

## Fields

 * _[gene to gene association.object](gene_to_gene_association_object.md)_
    * _the object gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa_

 * _[gene to gene association.subject](gene_to_gene_association_subject.md)_

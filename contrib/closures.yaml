    range: ontology class
    description: >-
      Ancestors (reflexive) of the object field following is_a (subClassOf) and part-of links.
      This is typically used as a query constraint and for faceting.
      The combination of is_a and part of is a common pattern, and can be used in gene expression
      queries (finding genes that are expressed in a structure, a subtype, or a part of that structure)
      or in GO queries (in any of the three branches of GO)

  - name: regulates closure
    is_a: closure concept slot
    range: relationship type
    description: >-
      Ancestors (reflexive) of the object field following is_a (subClassOf), part-of and
      regulates (including positive and negative) relationships.
      This is typically used as a query constraint and for faceting where the range is
      a biological process

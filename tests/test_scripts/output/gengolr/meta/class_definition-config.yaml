    context of a class. Many slots may be re-used across different classes, but the
    meaning of the slot may be refined by context. For example, a generic association
    model may use slots subject/predicate/object with generic semantics and minimal
    constraints. When this is subclasses, e.g. to disease-phenotype associations then
    slot_usage may specify both local naming (e.g. subject=disease) and local constraints',

- {description: 'Used to extend an existing class definition. For example, if we have
    a core schema where a gene has two slots for identifier and symbol, and we have
    a specialized schema for my_organism where we wish to add a slot systematic_name,
    we can avoid subclassing by defining a class gene_my_organism, adding the slot
    to this class, and then adding an apply_to pointing to the gene class. The new
    slot will be ''injected into'' the gene class.', display_name: apply_to, id: apply_to}

## Fields

 * [biomarker for](biomarker_for.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: holds between a measurable molecular entity and a disease or phenotypic feature, where the entity is used as an indicator of the presence or state of the disease or feature.
    * range: [DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature.md)

    * range: [BiologicalSequence](BiologicalSequence.md)
    * inherited from: [GenomicEntity](GenomicEntity.md)
 * [has phenotype](has_phenotype.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: holds between a biological entity and a phenotype, where a phenotype is construed broadly as any kind of quality of an organism part, a collection of these qualities, or a change in quality or qualities (e.g. abnormally increased temperature). 
    * range: [Phenotype](Phenotype.md)
    * inherited from: [BiologicalEntity](BiologicalEntity.md)
 * [id](id.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)

    * range: [OrganismTaxon](OrganismTaxon.md)
    * inherited from: [ThingWithTaxon](ThingWithTaxon.md)
 * [iri](iri.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: An IRI for the node. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
    * range: [IriType](IriType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [macromolecular machine.name](macromolecular_machine_name.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: genes are typically designated by a short symbol and a full name. We map the symbol to the default display name and use an additional slot for full name
    * range: [SymbolType](SymbolType.md)
    * inherited from: [MacromolecularMachine](MacromolecularMachine.md)
 * [molecularly interacts with](molecularly_interacts_with.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)

 * [regulates, entity to entity](regulates_entity_to_entity.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: describes an entity that has a direct affect on the state or quality of another existing entity. Use of the 'affects' predicate implies that the affected entity already exists, unlike predicates such as 'affects risk for' and 'prevents, where the outcome is something that may or may not come to be.

# Class: gene product isoform


This is an abstract class that can be mixed in with different kinds of gene products to indicate that the gene product is intended to represent a specific isoform rather than a canonical or reference or generic product. The designation of canonical or reference may be arbitrary, or it may represent the superclass of all isoforms.

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [gene product](GeneProduct.md) - The functional molecular product of a single gene. Gene products are either proteins or functional RNA molecules
## Children

 *  mixin: [RNA product isoform](RnaProductIsoform.md) - Represents a protein that is a specific isoform of the canonical or reference RNA
 *  mixin: [protein isoform](ProteinIsoform.md) - Represents a protein that is a specific isoform of the canonical or reference protein. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114032/

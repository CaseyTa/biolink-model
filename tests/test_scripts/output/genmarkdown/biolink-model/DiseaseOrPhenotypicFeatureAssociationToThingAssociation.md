## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
## Children

 *  child: [disease or phenotypic feature association to location association](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociationToLocationAssociation.md) - An association between either a disease or a phenotypic feature and an anatomical entity, where the disease/feature manifests in that site.
## Used in

 * _[has phenotype](has_phenotype.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)_
    * _holds between a biological entity and a phenotype, where a phenotype is construed broadly as any kind of quality of an organism part, a collection of these qualities, or a change in quality or qualities (e.g. abnormally increased temperature). _
    * range: [Phenotype](Phenotype.md)
    * inherited from: [BiologicalEntity](BiologicalEntity.md)
 * _[id](id.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)_

 * _[regulates, process to process](regulates_process_to_process.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)_
    * _describes an entity that has a direct affect on the state or quality of another existing entity. Use of the 'affects' predicate implies that the affected entity already exists, unlike predicates such as 'affects risk for' and 'prevents, where the outcome is something that may or may not come to be._

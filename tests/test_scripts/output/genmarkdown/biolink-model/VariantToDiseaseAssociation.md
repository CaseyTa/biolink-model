## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
 *  mixin: [variant to thing association](VariantToThingAssociation.md)
 *  mixin: [entity to disease association](EntityToDiseaseAssociation.md) - mixin class for any association whose object (target node) is a disease

 * _[frequency qualifier](frequency_qualifier.md)_
    * _a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how frequent the phenotype is observed in the subject_
    * range: [frequency value](FrequencyValue.md)

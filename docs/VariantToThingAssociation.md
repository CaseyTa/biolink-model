## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
## Children

 * [VariantToDiseaseAssociation](VariantToDiseaseAssociation.md) (mixin) 
 * [VariantToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](VariantToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin) 
 * [VariantToPopulationAssociation](VariantToPopulationAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An association between a variant and a population, where the variant has particular frequency in the population

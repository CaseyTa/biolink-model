## Fields

 * [association type](association_type.html)
    * _connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)_
    * __range__: [ontology class](OntologyClass.html)
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [subject](subject.html)
    * _the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa_
    * __range__: [gene or gene product](GeneOrGeneProduct.html) [required]
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [negated](negated.html)
    * _if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true_
    * __range__: xsd:boolean
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [relation](relation.html)
    * _the relationship type by which a subject is connected to an object in an association_
    * __range__: [relationship type](RelationshipType.html) [required]
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [object](object.html)
    * _the object gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa_
    * __range__: [gene or gene product](GeneOrGeneProduct.html) [required]
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [qualifiers](qualifiers.html)
    * _connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association_
    * __range__: [ontology class](OntologyClass.html)*
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [publications](publications.html)
    * _connects an association to publications supporting the association_
    * __range__: [publication](Publication.html)*
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [provided by](provided_by.html)
    * _connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it_
    * __range__: [provider](Provider.html)
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [id](id.html)
    * _A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI_
    * __range__: identifier type [required]

 * [name](name.html)
    * _A human-readable name for a thing_
    * __range__: label type
    * inherited from: [named thing](NamedThing.html)
 * [category](category.html)
    * _Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag_
    * __range__: label type

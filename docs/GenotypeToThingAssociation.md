## Fields

 * [association type](association_type.html)
    * _connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)_
    * __range__: [ontology class](OntologyClass.html)
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [subject](subject.html)
    * _genotype that is the subject of the association_
    * __range__: [genotype](Genotype.html) [required]
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [negated](negated.html)

    * __range__: xsd:boolean
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)

    * _the relationship type by which a subject is connected to an object in an association_
    * __range__: [relationship type](RelationshipType.html) [required]
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [object](object.html)
    * _connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object._

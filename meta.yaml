            framework (e.g. java classes, python classes) then is_a is used.

          description: >-
            Additional info on how a slot is used in the context of a class.
            Many slots may be re-used across different classes, but the meaning of the slot may be refined by context.
            For example, a generic association model may use slots subject/predicate/object with generic semantics and
            minimal constraints. When this is subclasses, e.g. to disease-phenotype associations then slot_usage may
            specify both local naming (e.g. subject=disease) and local constraints

          description: >-
            Used to extend an existing class definition. For example, if we have a core schema where a gene has two slots for identifier and symbol,
            and we have a specialized schema for my_organism where we wish to add a slot systematic_name, we can avoid subclassing by defining a class gene_my_organism,
            adding the slot to this class, and then adding an apply_to pointing to the gene class. The new slot will be 'injected into' the gene class.

    for a URI or a complete URI, display_name: id, id: id}
- {description: A human-readable name for a thing, display_name: name, id: name}
- {description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.
    Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database
    this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag, display_name: category, id: category}

  display_name: related to, id: related_to}
- {description: A grouping for any property that holds between a node and a value,
  display_name: node property, id: node_property}

    rules., display_name: iri, id: iri}

- {description: 'holds between a biological entity and a phenotype, where a phenotype
    is construed broadly as any kind of quality of an organism part, a collection
    of these qualities, or a change in quality or qualities (e.g. abnormally increased
    temperature). ', display_name: has phenotype, id: has_phenotype}

    interaction, display_name: molecularly interacts with, id: molecularly_interacts_with}
- {description: 'describes an entity that has a direct affect on the state or quality
    of another existing entity. Use of the ''affects'' predicate implies that the
    affected entity already exists, unlike predicates such as ''affects risk for''
    and ''prevents, where the outcome is something that may or may not come to be.',
